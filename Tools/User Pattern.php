			<h1>User Pattern Tool</h1>
			<p>
				<b>The User Pattern tool has a very similar function to other pattern tools, the only difference being that it allows the user to replicate a feature/geometry/body according to their own pattern design.</b>
				<br>
				A good example of this is the fixing holes in the face of a complex component where the layout is not a simple rectangular or circular pattern.
				<br></br>
				To start with, the user will first have to design the pattern on sketch
				<br>
				<img style="padding: 10px 0px;" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Pattern/Pattern.png">
				<br>
				Next, click on the user design icon
				<br>
				<img style="padding: 10px 0px;" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Pattern/Pattern1.png">
				<br>
				Finally select the sketch as the position and the features/geometry/body as the object
				<br>
				<img style="padding: 10px 0px;" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Pattern/Pattern2.png">
				<br>
				The pattern should now be created.
