			<h1>Dynamic Sectioning Tool</h1>
			<p>
			<b>
				The Dynamic Sectioning tool is used to create a section through a part / assembly.
			</b>
				 This can be useful when you have a complex project and want to see hidden details.
				<br>
				<br>
				To begin using the using this feature, create a body:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Dynamic/dynamic_body.png">
				<br>
				Click on the Dynamic Sectioning icon:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Dynamic/dynamic_sicon.gif">
				<br>
				The plane of the section will appear as a red cross:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Dynamic/dynamic_section1.png">
				<br>
				Clicking on different surfaces on the 3D model allows us to view the section from different angles.
				<br>
				Left clicking and holding on the red cross representation allows the plane of the section to be moved to different depths:
