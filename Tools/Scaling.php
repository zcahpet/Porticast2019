				<b>Scaling is a function that allows the user to scale the designed 3D model.</b>
				<br></br>
				This function is used on objects that could change in size due to various reasons e.g. thermal expansion, which occurs in the manufacturing stage. So, the original design needs to be then scaled up or down to account for these changes.
				<br></br>
				A good example is a pattern for a sand casting, or a tool for moulding a carbon fibre component. For an aluminium casting, the pattern has to be made slightly larger than the final component to allow for shrinkage when it cools during manufacture. For carbon fibre, the mould tool has to be made slightly smaller than the final component because of different rates of thermal expansion between the two materials.
				<br></br>
				The scaling icon can be found in “Transformation Features” toolbar, and looks like this;
				<br>

				<br></br>
				Next, select the reference point; this point is the centre of enlargement/shrinking.
