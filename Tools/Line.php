				Here you can create a line using various options, which are:
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Point - Point</li>
					<li>Point - Direction</li>
					<li>Angle / Normal to Curve</li>
					<li>Tangent to Curve</li>
					<li>Normal to Surface</li>
					<li>Bisecting</li>
				</ul>

				Each method of creating a line needs specific geometrical features for it to work. On the bottom left of the screen there will be a text prompt telling you what the next step is. This is very useful in helping to select the next element, depending on the line type you are making:
