			<h1>Pocket Tool</h1>
			<p>
			<b>
				The Pocket tool is a feature that creates holes.
			</b>
			<br>
				Unlike the Hole tool, pockets can create non-round features.
				<br>
				<br>
				There are 3 types of pockets:
				<h3>Pocket</h3>

				<br>
				A pocket removes material from an existing solid. To start off with the profile/sketch of the pocket has to be created, usually on the pad’s surface. Then the depth can be entered by using dimensions or existing geometry in the part. A second limit can also be used to control the pocket dimensions if required. The “Thick” option reduces the size of the pocket by the width of the ‘wall’. Mirrored extent replicates the pocket in the opposite direction. Reverse direction reverses the direction of the pocket.

				<h3> Drafted Filleted Pocket</h3>

				<br>
				Select the profile to pocket, then enter a length for the depth of the pocket. For the second limit a plane parallel to the sketch has to be selected, so it can find another plane to finish off the pocket. Then the draft angle can be selected. The neutral element is the plane that will be unchanged by the draft. Then fillets can be selected to round off the edges of the pocket. Reverse direction changes the direction in which the pocket is created.
				<br>
				<h3> Multi-Pocket</h3>

				<br>
				Multipocket is a tool used to pocket multiple faces at once. The faces will be created on one sketch where they do not intersect with one another. When the tool is selected, for each domain enter a thickness value, and when this is done ok can be selected. To change the direction in which the pocket is created use the reverse direction button, which can be found after pressing more.
