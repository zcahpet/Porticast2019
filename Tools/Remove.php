				<br>
				Click OK. The region where the objects intersect should be removed along with the body you chose to remove, leaving behind a cube with a hemispherical shape missing, as seen in the image below. You will also notice that the bodies have merged into 1 Part Body in the tree, and “Remove” appears on a branch of the tree.
