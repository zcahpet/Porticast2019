			<h1>Plane Tool</h1>
			<p>
				A Plane is a flat surface on which you can sketch. They are used to create more complex shapes and can be defined in a number of ways:
				<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Offset from Plane</li>
					<li>Parallel through Point</li>
					<li>Angle / Normal to Plane</li>
					<li>Through 3 Points</li>
					<li>Through 2 Lines</li>
					<li>Through a Point and a Line</li>
					<li>Through Planar Curve</li>
					<li>Normal to Curve</li>
					<li>Tangent to Curve</li>
					<li>Equation</li>
					<li>Mean through Point</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				Click on the Plane icon:

				<br>
				The following dialogue box should open:
				<br>

				<br>
				CATIA's predictions of which plane to use can be frustrating. To deactivate it, click the green padlock.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Offset From Plane</h3>
				Creates a plane which is offset from the reference plane:
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_offset.png">
				<br>
				Ticking the Repeat object option after OK allow the user to create more offset planes, with each plane separated from the initial plane by a multiple of the offset value:
				<br>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Parallel Through Point</h3>
				Creates a plane on a reference plane and point:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_parallel.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Angle / Normal to Plane</h3>
				Creates a plane at given angle with respect to the reference plane: 
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_angle.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Through 3 Points</h3>
				Creates a plane which passes through 3 points: 
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_3points.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Through 2 Lines</h3>
				Creates a plane which passes through 2 Lines. If the lines are not co-planar, it will be buit on the second line. This can be avoided by ticking "Forbid non coplanar lines" :
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_2lines.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Through a Point and a Line</h3>
				Creates a plane which passes through a point and a line:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_pointline.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Through Planar Curve</h3>
				Creates on the same plane as a selected curve:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_curve.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Normal to Curve</h3>
				Creates a plane normal to the selected curve. By default the plane is created at the mid-point. To select a different part, create a point on the curve and select it as the reference:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_normal.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Tangent to Curve</h3>
				Creates a plane tangent to the selected curve. By default the plane is created at the mid-point. To select a different part, create a point on the curve and select it as the reference:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_normal.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Equation</h3>
				Creates a plane by inputting an equation. It should be in the standard form Ax+By+Cz=D. The user can also select a point to replace D as the distance away from the origin:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Plane/plane_equation.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Mean through Points</h3>
				Creates a plane through the mean of at least 3 selected points. The user can edit the plane by removing or replacing one or multiple points:
