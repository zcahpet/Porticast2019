			<h1>Pad Tool</h1>
			<p>
			<b>
				The pad tool is used on a 2D sketch in order to extrude it into a 3D object.
			</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				Firstly, you will need to create a sketch:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Pad/pad_sketch.png">
				<br>
				Click on the Pad icon:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Pad/pad_icon.gif">
				<br>
				There are 3 types of pad you can use:
				<br>
				<h3>Pad</h3>
				<br>
				Select the profile to pad. The following dialogue box should appear:
				<br>
				<img class="tools_image" src="Tools/Tools_Images/Pad/pad_box.png">
				<br>
				You can use the standard length input to dimension the pad, or limits such as up to next/last/plane/surface. By using the thickness option, the pad will become more like a shell. The mirror option replicates  replicates the pad in the opposite direction. The Reverse direction option reverses the direction of the pad. Try experimenting with all the options available to understand what they can do.:

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Drafted Filleted Pad</h3>
				<br>
				Select the profile to pad, then enter a length for the depth of the pad. For the second limit a plane parallel to the sketch has to be selected, so it can find another plane to finish off the pad. Then the draft angle can be selected. The neutral element is the plane that will be unchanged by the draft. Then fillets can be selected to round off the edges of the pad. Reverse direction changes the direction in which the pad is created.
				<br>
				<h3>Multi-Pad</h3>
				<br>
				Multipad is a tool used to pad multiple faces at once. The faces will be created on one sketch where they do not intersect with one another. When using this tool, enter a thickness value for each domain and click ok. To change the direction in which the pad is created use the reverse direction button; this is under the “more” tab.
