			<h1>Fillet Radius Tool</h1>
			<p>
			<b>
				The Fillet Radius tool is used to round off features on a part; these can be internal or external edges.
			</b>
				There are a number of reasons why this might be done.
				<br>
				<br>
				Internal edges are rounded to:
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Reduce stress concentration</li>
					<li>Remove sharp edges</li>
					<li>Reduce interference drag</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				External edges are rounded to:
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Remove sharp edges</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				<br>
				<br>
				The Fillet Radius tool can be found in the ‘Dress-Up Features’ toolbar, as shown below:
